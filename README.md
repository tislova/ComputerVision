## Seam Carving: Content-Aware Image Resizing

This project explores **seam carving**, a technique for content-aware image resizing. Unlike standard scaling, seam carving removes connected paths of low-importance pixels, preserving important image structures while reducing width or height.

The implementation is written in Python and includes custom energy functions, seam-finding algorithms, and a comparison with standard resizing methods.
